</div>

`Vanilla JS` and `DOM Manipulation` used to implement Star UI rating system,

<div>
    <img src="/screenshots/screen7.png" width="560px" height="320px"</img> 
</div>

Clicking on a star will highlight all the previous stars, and stay highlighted unless you click on another star, and change the `React` component's local state.

Hovering over a star with highlight all the previous stars of the one that is currently being hovered over...

<div>
    <img src="/screenshots/screen9.png" width="560px" height="320px"</img> 
</div>

And then hovering away from a star with highlight all the previous stars of the one that is currently been selected. If no selection has been made yet, all stars are unhighlighted.

### City Highlights

</div>

Data about all the cities is passed from container component using `Redux` state. Highest rated city, lowest rated city, and most reviewed city are calculated with `Vanilla Javascript`.

<div>
    <img src="/screenshots/screen13.png" width="600px" height="370px"</img> 
</div>

`React` is used to create UI component with a link directing user to that city's show page, using `React`'s `Link` and `Router` features.
